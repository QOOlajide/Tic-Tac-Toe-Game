# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe (Vibe-Coding Edition)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a modern take on the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game — not built for a portfolio boost, but as part of my **Vibe-Coding** learning approach.  
The goal was to step away from large-scale “serious” projects and focus on **rapid, hands-on learning** by coding something small yet complete.  

I built the game **twice**:
- **With a standard AI assistant** (ChatGPT)  
- **With an AI-powered IDE code companion** (Cursor)  

This allowed me to reflect on how different AI coding tools influence learning speed, understanding, and debugging skills.

## 🎯 Purpose
While this may seem like a simple project, its value lies in:
- Practicing *iterative problem solving*.
- Using AI coding tools effectively without losing **ownership of the code**.
- Reinforcing core web development skills through small, contained challenges.
- Documenting a repeatable **Vibe-Coding Framework**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML** – Structure of the game board and UI.
- **CSS** – Styling for layout, game visuals, and alignment.
- **JavaScript** – Game logic, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.

## 📖 Vibe-Coding Framework
Here’s the workflow I followed to keep learning fast while maintaining understanding:

1. **Restart When Debugging Errors**  
   If something’s off (e.g., X’s and O’s not centered), undo, clarify requirements, and try again.

2. **Consult Documentation Frequently**  
   Use official docs (like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)) to verify methods, parameters, and best practices.

3. **Edit Incrementally**  
   Change one thing at a time and observe the effect.

4. **Create Future Tasks & Subtasks**  
   Break down goals into small, actionable items.

5. **Document Everything**  
   Keep a coding journal of challenges, fixes, and lessons learned.
